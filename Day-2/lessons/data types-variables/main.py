# Simple datatypes
# 1 -  Strings everything that is into QUOTES "" -> "hello", "%$&", "123"
# 2 -  Integer, all integer number negative or positive -> 12, 345, -543, 0 --
# 3 -  Floats, non int number, number with -> 1.25, -45.765 
# 4 -  booleans -> True or False, useful for logival algorithms. useful to make decisions

# Collections
# LISTS -> ordered collections of object ( similar to array ) in square brackets ["John", "Fred", "Anna"], [1, 3, -43]
# Each object has an index  ["John", "Fred", "Anna"], [1, 3, -43]
#  indexes ->                  0       1       2       0  1    2
# Lists are MUTABLE ! we can read, append, remove or re order lists

# TUPLES -> verry similar to LIST but write with parentheses ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday) tuples have indexes too
# THEY ARE IMMUTABLE !! we can do re order, append or other things like lists

# DICTIONARIES -> group of object in to curly braces, with key values pair. No index in a dictionnary.
# {"color": "orange", "dog": "Pincher"}
#    key     value

# SETS collections of UNIQUE et UNREPEATABLE elements, is difffrent to list, tuple or dict witch can have multiple same elements.
